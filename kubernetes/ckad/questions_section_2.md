## Kubernetes developer - Application Deployment

> Give me examples of the application deployment section for the Kubernetes developer exam.

Certainly! In the **Application Deployment** section of the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exam, you'll work with various Kubernetes resources to deploy and manage applications. Here are some examples:

1. **Deployments**:
    - Create a simple web application deployment using a Deployment manifest.
    - Specify the desired number of replicas, container images, and ports.
    - Update the deployment to a new version of the application.

2. **StatefulSets**:
    - Deploy a stateful application (e.g., a database) using a StatefulSet.
    - Configure persistent storage for StatefulSets.
    - Understand ordered pod creation and deletion.

3. **DaemonSets**:
    - Use a DaemonSet to ensure a specific pod runs on every node.
    - Deploy monitoring agents or log collectors as DaemonSets.

4. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**:
    - Create a ConfigMap to store configuration data (e.g., environment variables).
    - Define a Secret for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords).

5. **Pod Design**:
    - Create pods directly (not recommended) and understand when to use controllers (like Deployments).
    - Set pod affinity and anti-affinity rules.

6. **Init Containers**:
    - Design an init container to perform setup tasks before the main container starts.
    - Use init containers for database schema migrations or configuration checks.

7. **Multi-Container Pods**:
    - Deploy pods with multiple containers sharing the same network namespace.
    - Examples include sidecar containers for logging or monitoring.

8. **Resource Requests and Limits**:
    - Specify CPU and memory requests and limits in pod definitions.
    - Understand how resource constraints affect scheduling and performance.

9. **Pod Lifecycle Hooks**:
    - Use lifecycle hooks (preStart, postStart, preStop) for actions during pod startup and shutdown.

10. **Application Autoscaling**:
    - Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU or custom metrics.
    - Observe how the cluster scales the application based on demand.

Remember to practice creating and managing these resources in a Kubernetes cluster. Hands-on experience is crucial for success in the CKAD exam. Good luck with your preparation! ðŸŒŸðŸš€
