    - Monitor CPU and memory usage.
    - Optimize resource requests and limits.
    - Identify and address resource bottlenecks.

4. **Health Checks and Probes**:
    - Configure readiness and liveness probes in pod definitions.
    - Understand the difference between the two types of probes.
    - Handle pod failures gracefully.

5. **Troubleshooting Techniques**:
    - Investigate pod crashes and failures.
    - Use `kubectl describe` to get detailed information about resources.
    - Inspect events and status conditions.

6. **Backup and Restore Strategies**:
    - Understand how to back up and restore data in stateful applications.
    - Use tools like Velero for backup and recovery.

7. **Application Upgrades and Rollbacks**:
    - Perform rolling updates using Deployments.
    - Understand how to roll back to a previous version.
    - Use Helm for package management and upgrades.

8. **Blue/Green and Canary Deployments**:

    - Understand how to switch traffic between different versions.

9. **Security and Access Control**:
    - Set up RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for users and services.
    - Ensure proper access to secrets and sensitive data.

10. **Cluster Maintenance**:
    - Perform node maintenance tasks (e.g., draining nodes).
    - Upgrade Kubernetes versions.
    - Handle certificate renewals.

Remember to practice these concepts hands-on in a Kubernetes cluster. Explore real-world scenarios and troubleshoot issues to gain confidence. Best of luck with your CKAD preparation! ðŸŒŸðŸš€
