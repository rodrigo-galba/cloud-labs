## Kubernetes Developer exam
The **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exam certifies that candidates can design, build, and deploy cloud-native applications for Kubernetes. If you're preparing for the CKAD exam, here are the key topics you should focus on:

1. **Application Design and Build (20%)**:
    - Understand how to define application resources using Kubernetes manifests (YAML or JSON).
    - Create and manage Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets.
    - Work with ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management.
    - Use labels and selectors effectively.

2. **Application Deployment (20%)**:
    - Understand how to deploy applications using Pods.
    - Configure readiness and liveness probes.
    - Manage rolling updates and rollbacks.
    - Use Jobs and CronJobs for batch processing.

3. **Application Observability and Maintenance (15%)**:
    - Monitor application health using metrics and logs.
    - Troubleshoot application issues.
    - Understand how to scale applications horizontally and vertically.
    - Implement resource limits and requests.

4. **Application Environment, Configuration, and Security (25%)**:
    - Work with environment variables and ConfigMaps.
    - Set up security contexts for Pods.
    - Understand network policies and implement them.
    - Secure communication between Pods using Services and Ingress.

5. **Services and Networking (20%)**:
    - Create and manage Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
    - Understand DNS resolution within the cluster.
    - Configure network policies for communication control.
    - Use Ingress controllers for external access.

Remember that the CKAD exam is performance-based and requires hands-on experience. Practice creating and managing Kubernetes resources in a real or simulated environment. Good luck with your preparation! üåüüöÄ
