# Kubernetes - Developer Services and Networking (20%)

Certainly! In the **Services and Networking** section of the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exam, you'll work with various aspects related to application communication and network policies. Here are some examples:

1. **Creating a Service**:
    - Define a Service YAML manifest to expose a set of pods.
    - Use ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer service types.
    - Ensure the service selects the correct pods using labels.

2. **Network Policies**:
    - Create a NetworkPolicy to control ingress and egress traffic.
    - Restrict communication between pods based on labels.
    - Understand how network policies affect pod connectivity.

3. **Service Discovery**:
    - Use DNS to discover services within the cluster.
    - Understand how services are resolved by name.

4. **Headless Services**:
    - Create a headless service (without a ClusterIP) for StatefulSets.
    - Use headless services for stateful applications.

5. **Ingress Controllers**:
    - Set up an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx, Traefik).
    - Define Ingress rules to route external traffic to services.

6. **NodePort Services**:
    - Create a NodePort service to expose a pod externally.
    - Understand how NodePort services work.

7. **LoadBalancer Services**:
    - Use LoadBalancer services to expose applications externally.
    - Configure cloud-specific load balancers.

8. **Service Discovery with Environment Variables**:
    - Set environment variables in pods to access services.
    - Use service names as DNS names in environment variables.

9. **Service Endpoints**:
    - Understand how services maintain a list of endpoints (pods).
    - Inspect service endpoints using `kubectl get endpoints`.

10. **Service Labels and Selectors**:
    - Ensure services match the correct pods using labels.
    - Verify that services select the expected pods.

Remember to practice creating and managing these resources in a Kubernetes cluster. Hands-on experience is essential for success in the CKAD exam. Good luck with your preparation! ðŸŒŸðŸš€
