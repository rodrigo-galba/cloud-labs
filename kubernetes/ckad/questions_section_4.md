# Kubernetes Developer - Application Environment, Configuration, and Security (25%)v  

Certainly! In the **Application Environment, Configuration, and Security** section of the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exam, you'll work with various aspects related to application configuration and security. Here are some examples and topics you should be familiar with:

1. **Environment Variables and ConfigMaps**:
    - Define environment variables in pod specifications.
    - Use ConfigMaps to manage configuration data (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
    - Inject ConfigMap values into pods as environment variables.

2. **Secrets**:
    - Create Secrets to securely store sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens).
    - Use Secrets for database credentials or API keys.
    - Mount Secrets as files or environment variables in pods.

3. **Security Contexts**:
    - Set security context fields in pod specifications.
    - Configure user and group IDs, run as non-root, and limit capabilities.
    - Understand how security contexts affect container behavior.

4. **Network Policies**:
    - Define network policies to control communication between pods.
    - Restrict ingress and egress traffic based on labels and namespaces.
    - Ensure secure communication within the cluster.

5. **Service Accounts and RBAC**:
    - Create Service Accounts for pods.
    - Understand Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules.
    - Assign roles and role bindings to control access to resources.

6. **Pod Security Policies (PSP)**:
    - Understand PSPs and their impact on pod creation.
    - Define policies to restrict privileged containers and host namespaces.

7. **Resource Quotas and Limits**:
    - Set resource quotas to limit CPU and memory usage per namespace.
    - Define resource limits for individual pods.

8. **Secrets Encryption at Rest**:
    - Enable encryption for Secrets stored in etcd.
    - Understand how Kubernetes handles encryption keys.

9. **Pod Identity and Service Accounts**:
    - Associate pods with specific Service Accounts.
    - Use Service Account tokens for authentication.

10. **Security Best Practices**:
    - Keep container images up to date.
    - Avoid running containers as root.
    - Regularly audit and review security configurations.

Remember to practice these concepts in a Kubernetes cluster and explore real-world scenarios. Good luck with your CKAD preparation! ðŸŒŸðŸš€
