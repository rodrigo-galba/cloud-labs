Certainly! The **Application Design and Build** section of the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exam focuses on designing and creating Kubernetes resources for cloud-native applications. Here are some examples and topics you should be familiar with:

1. **Creating Deployments**:
    - Define a Deployment YAML manifest to create a scalable application.
    - Specify the desired number of replicas, container images, and ports.
    - Set environment variables and resource limits.

2. **StatefulSets**:
    - Create a StatefulSet for stateful applications (e.g., databases).
    - Understand how StatefulSets handle ordered pod creation and deletion.
    - Configure persistent storage for StatefulSets.

3. **DaemonSets**:
    - Design a DaemonSet to ensure a pod runs on every node.
    - Use DaemonSets for monitoring agents or log collectors.

4. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**:
    - Create a ConfigMap to store configuration data (e.g., environment variables).
    - Define a Secret for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords).

5. **Labels and Selectors**:
    - Apply labels to pods and services.
    - Use selectors to target specific pods for services or deployments.

6. **Pod Design**:
    - Understand how to create pods directly (not recommended) and when to use controllers (Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.).
    - Set pod affinity and anti-affinity rules.

7. **Init Containers**:
    - Design an init container to perform setup tasks before the main container starts.
    - Use init containers for database schema migrations or configuration checks.

8. **Multi-Container Pods**:
    - Create pods with multiple containers sharing the same network namespace.
    - Examples include sidecar containers for logging or monitoring.

9. **Resource Requests and Limits**:
    - Specify CPU and memory requests and limits in pod definitions.
    - Understand how resource constraints affect scheduling and performance.

10. **Pod Lifecycle Hooks**:
    - Use lifecycle hooks (preStart, postStart, preStop) to perform actions during pod startup and shutdown.

Remember to practice creating these resources in a Kubernetes cluster. You can find additional examples and exercises on platforms like Udemy, GitHub, and KodeKloud. Good luck with your CKAD preparation! üåüüöÄ
